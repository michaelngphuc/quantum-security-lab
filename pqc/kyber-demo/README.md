# Kyber KEM Demo

This module contains an implementation and demonstration of the CRYSTALS-Kyber
Key Encapsulation Mechanism (PQC finalist selected by NIST).

## Goals
- Implement Kyber512 key generation, encryption (encapsulation), and decryption (decapsulation)
- Show how lattice-based cryptography resists quantum attacks
- Compare performance vs RSA/ECC
- Provide clean Python example using pqcrypto library

## Status
- Not started
