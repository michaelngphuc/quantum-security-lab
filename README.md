# 🔐 quantum-security-lab

A research-focused repository exploring **quantum-safe cryptography**,  
**post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (ML-KEM / Kyber)**,  
and **quantum communication (QKD)**.

Maintained by **Michael Nguyen Phuc**,  
Master of Cyber Security @ **RMIT University**  
with research interests in **quantum security, PQC, and cryptanalysis**.

## 🚀 Research Focus

This lab investigates the intersection of **quantum computing** and **cyber security**, including:

### 🔸 *Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)*
- ML-KEM (Kyber) implementations  
- Lattice-based key exchange  
- Zero-knowledge assumptions  
- Code-based & hash-based cryptography  
- Migration planning for PQ-safe systems  

### 🔸 *Quantum Communication*
- Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) — BB84, E91  
- Entanglement-based protocols  
- Quantum randomness  
- Quantum channel modelling  

### 🔸 *Breaking Classical Crypto with Quantum Algorithms*
- Shor’s algorithm (RSA & ECC factorisation)  
- Grover’s algorithm (symmetric key search)  
- Cryptographic vulnerability analysis  
- Risk modelling for organizations
